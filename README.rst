SimComPyl - composable, compiled and pure python
------------------------------------------------

|Build Status| |Coverage|


SimComPyl is a framework to write discrete time simulation. It focuses on ease
of development as well as execution speed. This is archived by compiling pure
composable python classes with numba:

  Thousends of decisions of millions of individuals 
  can be simulated within seconds.

The framework can be used to run any time-descrete simulation, e.g. you could use
it to get more insights and predictions on the behaviour of sea-life, a mesh network
or your customers.
