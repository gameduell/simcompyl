Simulhave - Simulated Behaviour
===============================

|Build Status| |Coverage|


Simulhave is a framework to write simulations for the behaviour of large
populations rapidly, focusing on speed of development as well as execution.
This is archieved by combining pythons cooperative inheritance for composability
with a numba optimized execution of the simualted environment. 

  Thousends of decisions of millions of individuals 
  can be simulated within seconds.

The framework can be used to run time-descrete simulation, e.g. you could use
it to get more insights and predictions on the behaviour of sea-life or your
customers.
